  <h2>Introduction to the World Wide Web</h2>
  <p>The way the web works is that the browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to you, the client. A web server, as hardware is a computer that stores web server software and other files related to a website, such as HTML documents, images and JavaScript files. When a web browser, needs a file that's hosted on a web server, the browser will request the file by HTTP. A web browser, in simple terms, is an application used to access and view websites. Examples of web browsers include Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.</p>
  
  <h2>How is the world wide web different to the internet?</h2>
  <p>The world wide web, or web for short, are the pages you see when you're at a device and you're online. But the internet is the network of connected computers that the web works on, as well as what emails and files travel across. the World Wide Web is just one common area for information exchange, facilitated by global computer networks also known as the Internet.</p>

  <h2>What is an intranet? How does it relate to the internet?</h2>
  <p>An intranet is a private network contained within an enterprise that is used to securely share company information and computing resources among employees. An intranet site is an internal website (or portal) that helps employees stay up-to-date with their company. It serves as a website, communications channel, knowledge management tool, and collaboration platform. </p>

  <h2>What is an internet protocol? Comparing HTTP, TCP/IP and FTP.</h2>
  <p>The Internet Protocol, IP, is a protocol, or set of rules, for routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. The main types of protocols are HTTP, TCP/IP and FTP. FTP is a file transfer protocol, which means it is used to transfer files between a client and a server, whereas TCP is a communication protocol used to exchange data between networks. They come together when FTP sends data over a TCP/IP connection. FTP is more efficient at transferring large files, whereas HTTP is better for transferring smaller files such as web pages. Although both utilize TCP as the protocol of choice, HTTP uses a persistent connection, thus making the performance of the TCP better with HTTP than with FTP.</p>
